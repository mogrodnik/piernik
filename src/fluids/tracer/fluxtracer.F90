!! \brief Computation of %fluxes for the tracer fluid
!!
!!The flux functions for dust are given by:
!!\f[
!!  \vec{F}{(\vec{u})} =
!!  \left(\begin{array}{c}
!!    \rho v_x \\
!!  \end{array}\right),
!!  \qquad
!!  \vec{G}{(\vec{u})} =
!!  \left(\begin{array}{c}
!!    \rho v_y \\
!!  \end{array}\right),
!!\qquad
!!  \vec{H}{(\vec{u})} =
!!  \left(\begin{array}{c}
!!    \rho v_z \\
